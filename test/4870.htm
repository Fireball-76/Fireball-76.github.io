						<h3>Castle Dour</h3>
<div class="gameplay_image">

<p>Dominating the city&rsquo;s northern district is Castle Dour. Thick-walled and imposing, it protected its inhabitants from invaders. As the city grew, walls were added to surround the other, newer buildings.</p>
<p>During a long period of peace, the Blue Palace was built for the Jarl, and Castle Dour became a secondary fortress. It now houses the Imperial Garrison and the Temple of the Divines. Find a couple of Skill Books around the sleeping area here:</p>
<p><em>Skill Book [Light Armor]: The Rear Guard [D1/10]</em></p>

<p><strong>Fihada</strong><br /><strong>Jawanan</strong></p>
<p>Fihada runs this shop with his apprentice Jawanan. There are a large number of fine weapons to buy (or to steal) here. There&rsquo;s a chest in the ground-floor bedroom and a ledger and strongbox upstairs.</p>
<p><em>Trader (Fletcher): Fihada [1/3]</em><br /><em>- Weapons and Misc</em><br /><em>Skill Book [Archery]: The Gold Ribbon of Merit [C1/10]</em><br /><em>Business Ledger</em><br /><em>Strongbox (Adept)</em><br /><em>Chest</em><br /><em>Potions aplenty</em><br /><em>Loose gear</em></p>

<p><strong>Beirand</strong><br /><strong>Helmvar</strong></p>
<p>Beirand works for the army and the city guard. However, he has permission to do work on the side, making and repairing weapons and armor for anyone who comes in. However, he can&rsquo;t let it interfere with his other work.</p>
<p>Should Beirand die, his apprentice Helmvar will take over. Beirand is married to Sayma and has a son named Kayd. Outside his shop is a full complement of crafting locations and a second grindstone inside the Blacksmith&rsquo;s. Up in Beirand&rsquo;s bedroom, there&rsquo;s a ledger, Skill Book, and strongbox.</p>
<p><em>Crafting: Blacksmith&rsquo;s Forge</em><br /><em>Crafting: Grindstones (2)</em><br /><em>Crafting: Workbench</em><br /><em>Trader (Blacksmith): Beirand [1/33]</em><br /><em>- Weapons, Apparel, and Misc</em><br /><em>Skill Book [Light Armor]: The Refugees [E1/10]</em><br /><em>Business Ledger</em><br /><em>Strongbox (Adept)</em></p>
<h4>16) Courtyard and Crenellations</h4>
<p><strong>Captain Aldis</strong></p>
<p>The ground-level features Solitude Guards practicing archery and sword strikes. Captain Aldis presides over this training, along with the execution you saw as you walked in.</p>
<p>Head up the stone ramp to the crenellations, allowing quick (and more stealthy) access above the castle grounds to an upper entrance into Castle Dour and the Thalmor Headquarters, the Temple of the Divines, and then back into the market district.</p>
<p>You can even drop off these crenellations, grabbing hanging moss or a bird&rsquo;s nest if you&rsquo;re facing southeast.</p>
<h4>17) Castle Dour (Interior)</h4>
<p><strong>General Tullius</strong><br /><strong>Legate Rikke</strong><br /><strong>Ahtar the Jailor</strong><br /><strong>Gianna</strong></p>
<p>In ages gone by, there was just the castle keep. Thick walled and imposing, it protected its inhabitants from invaders. As the city grew, walls were added to surround the other, newer buildings. During a long period of peace, a separate palace was built for the Jarl.</p>
<p>Castle Dour became an oversized gatehouse. It was eventually converted into the city&rsquo;s Imperial Garrison. General Tullius is in charge of the Imperial forces in Skyrim. He lives and works here along with his second in command, Legate Rikke.</p>
<p><em>Follower: Ahtar the Jailor [2/47]</em><br /><em>Unique Weapon: Headsman&rsquo;s Axe [1/80]</em></p>
<p>General Tullius&rsquo;s War Room (Ground Floor)</p>
<p>The main level of the castle is given over to a battle map of Skyrim, where General Tullius and Legate Rikke plan the countermeasures against the Stormcloaks. It is here you can join with them during the Civil War Quests.</p>
<p>Civil War: Map of Skyrim</p>
<p>Loose gear<br />Legate Rikke&rsquo;s Room (Ground Floor)</p>
<p>A simple dining table and bed.</p>
<p>General Tullius&rsquo;s Room (Upper Floor)</p>
<p>This connects to the War Room and the crenellations exit via a corridor and stairs. A large bed dominates this chamber.</p>
<p><em>Potions</em><br /><em>Loose gear</em></p>
<p>Garrison Barracks (Lower Floor)</p>
<p>Legate Aventus Caesennius runs a tight ship down here where the city guards and conscripts sleep. There&rsquo;s a kitchen here filled with food and an armory of Imperial weapons and equipment.</p>
<p><em>Skill Book [Light Armor]: The Rear-Guard [D1/10]</em></p>
<p>Loose gear<br />Castle Dour Dungeon (Lower Floor)</p>
<p>Commit a crime in Haafingar and the guards will throw you in the dungeons of Castle Dour. Ahtar the Jailor (who was part of the execution when you first arrived in Solitude) runs this place. The upper level is a circular balcony overlooking the dungeon level. There are guards, scattered food and weapons, and three chambers along the outer wall to your right.</p>
<p>The first is an interrogation room, the second is a torture room, and the third is Ahtar&rsquo;s office, with steps leading down to the evidence chamber on the lower level. Notice the hole in the wall near the belongings chest? This allows you to recover your equipment when escaping through the secret passage.</p>
<p><em>Evidence Chest</em><br /><em>Prisoner Belongings Chest</em><br /><em>Loose gear</em></p>
<p>Castle Dour Dungeon (Dungeon Floor)</p>
<p>The roughly circular lower level features seven cells, most of them locked. Bjartur, a Stormcloak Soldier, is held in one of the cells if the Imperials control the city. You&rsquo;re usually placed in a cell on the jail&rsquo;s south side.</p>
<p>Instead of serving out your sentence, check the crumbling mortar on the wall behind you. It falls away, enabling you to flee into a dungeon corridor. Check the small hole, allowing you to reach into the Prisoner Belongings Chest in the evidence room.</p>
<p>Then flee to the ladder, bringing you up into the Market District, [B] Castle Dour Dungeon Exit. Note that you can only do this once; after you escape, the guards repair the wall, and you&rsquo;ll have to serve your time or escape in the usual way in the future.</p>
<p><em>Prisoner Belongings</em></p>
<h4>18) Emperor&rsquo;s Tower (Interior)</h4>
<p><strong>Emperor Titus Mede III</strong></p>
<p>Reviled by the Stormcloaks for his &ldquo;betrayal&rdquo; in the Markarth Incident and admired by the Imperials and Loyalists for his steadfastness during the Great War, Titus Mede is somewhat of a tragic figure, being forced by the weakness of the Empire to make deals with those he despises (the Thalmor) in order to preserve the Empire from total destruction.</p>
<p>This is the residence of the Emperor when he is in Solitude. You will come here for Dark Brotherhood Quest: To Kill an Empire.</p>
<p>Throne Room (Ground Floor)</p>
<p>Emperor Titus Mede III isn&rsquo;t usually here. This offers access to the kitchens and the upper floor.</p>
<p>Kitchens (Ground Floor)</p>
<p>As you&rsquo;d expect, there&rsquo;s an abundance of food, tended to by the chef.</p>
<p>Upper Landing (Upper Floor)</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an empty bedroom and a door requiring a key, unlocked by the chef during the quest. A Skill Book rests on a table in the small sitting area.</p>
<p>Skill Book [Enchanting]: Catalogue of Weapon Enchantments</p>
<p>Banqueting Hall (Upper Floor)</p>
<p>This is where the Emperor and his trusted cohorts eat and talk about politics. There is an exit out to the South Gate (windmill).</p>
<h4><strong>19) Thalmor Headquarters</strong></h4>
<p>The hated Justiciars are headquartered in the garrison. Effectively run by the Thalmor, they oversee the terms of the peace accords signed by the Empire. Principally, this means rooting out Talos worshippers. Elenwen is the head of the Justiciars.</p>
<p>Sometimes she forces her opinion on General Tullius as well. He has little use for her advice, but his emperor has commanded him to follow her orders on matters related to the treaty.</p>
<p>Mostly this location is relatively empty, with the Thalmor more content to rule Skyrim from the remote Embassy in the mountains above Solitude. Check inside for a number of books to read, and the following:</p>

<h4><strong>20) Temple of the Divines</strong></h4>

<img src="jpg/sr_atlas/jpg/sr_atlas/sr_atlas_1a-008.jpg" tppabs="http://www.primagames.com/games/media/files/skyrim/jpg/sr_atlas/jpg/sr_atlas/sr_atlas_1a-008.jpg" border="0" width="437" /></div>
<p><strong>Rorlund</strong><br /><strong>Freir</strong><br /><strong>Silana Petreia</strong></p>
<p>Formerly the Temple of the Nine Divines, this is the largest temple in all of Skyrim. Unlike the other temples, it reflects the Imperial view of all eight divinities being equal and represented. Outside is a small courtyard where Vittoria Vici&rsquo;s marriage will take place.</p>
<p>There are several doors leading to and from the roof if you want a better look down onto this courtyard. Inside are shrines for each of the eight gods, plus an empty place where the Shrine to Talos once stood.</p>
<p>If you side with the Stormcloaks during the Civil War Quests and take Solitude for Ulfric, the Shrine to Talos is reinstated. Each provides a Blessing.</p>
<p>Upstairs is a withdrawing area and exit to the crenellations. Downstairs is a storage room and a firmly sealed door, which can only be opened during Side Quest: The Wolf Queen Awakened. It leads to a second, dust-filled wine cellar, past a Health Potion to a hole in the wall and into Potema&rsquo;s Catacombs.</p>
<p><em>Unique Item: Asgeir&rsquo;s Wedding Band [1/112]</em><br /><em>Unique Item: Vittoria&rsquo;s Wedding Band [2/112]</em><br /><em>Unique Weapon: Firiniel&rsquo;s End [2/80]</em><br /><em>Shrine of Akatosh [1/6]</em><br /><em>Shrine of Arkay [1/12]</em><br /><em>Shrine of Arkay [1/12]</em><br /><em>Shrine of Dibella [1/8]</em><br /><em>Shrine of Julianos [1/5]</em><br /><em>Shrine of Kynareth [1/6]</em><br /><em>Shrine of Mara [1/5]</em><br /><em>Shrine of Stendarr [1/5]</em>&gt;<br /><em>Shrine of Talos [1/17]</em><br /><em>Shrine of Zenithar [1/5]</em></p>
<h4>The Avenues District</h4>
<p>Sometimes referred to as &ldquo;the Stately Avenues of Old Solitude,&rdquo; it&rsquo;s more commonly just called the Avenues. This is the residential section of the city.</p>
<h4>21) Hall of the Dead (Solitude Catacombs)</h4>

<p><strong>Styrr</strong></p>
<p>This mausoleum is filled with vaults. The dead of Haafingar are buried here. As the local priest of Arkay, Styrr is the cemetery caretaker. Although this could just be his demeanor, Styrr believes that darkness is drawn to Solitude.</p>
<p>Upstairs, Styrr&rsquo;s room has a long chest to pilfer from and a small chest behind the door. Into the cellar, there&rsquo;s the corridor to Solitude Catacombs.</p>

<p>Solitude Catacombs (Interior)</p>
<p>This houses the remains of the dead from across Haafingar. Expect three skeletons roaming these catacombs and an exit leading back out, onto the graveyard [D].</p>
<h4>22) Dervenin the Mad</h4>
<p><strong>Dervenin the Mad</strong></p>
<p>This lunatic beggar wanders around the Hall of the Dead graveyard and down the Avenues. He talks about his abandoned master, which is the prelude (and way to begin) Daedric Quest: The Mind of Madness. He also requests a gold coin from you. Oblige, and you receive the Gift of Charity.</p>
<p>Ability: The Gift of Charity</p>
<h4>D) Solitude Catacombs Exit</h4>
<h4>23) Vittoria Vici&rsquo;s House</h4>
<h4><strong>Vittoria Vici</strong></h4>
<p>Vittoria Vici heads down from this house to supervise the shipping and distribution of goods from the port. She is a wealthy woman, about to be married. Her house reflects this opulence, as do the Shadowmarks etched near the main doorway. There are three entrances.</p>
<p>The main floor of the house is comprised of a hallway, living area, and kitchen. There are books to read and food to eat. Upstairs is a small balcony library and a bedroom with a chest to check. In the cellar, there&rsquo;s an exit and a display case with a valuable weapon in it to steal.</p>
<p><em>Shadowmark: &ldquo;Loot&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Chest (2)<br />Loose gear</p>
<h4>24) Proudspire Manor (House for Sale)</h4>

<p>This dwelling is currently empty. It was the scene of a gruesome murder, and there&rsquo;s rumors of it being haunted.</p>
<p>Should you become the Thane of Haafingar (by completing Favors for the citizens and the Jarl), you can purchase this abode from Jarl Elisif the Fair&rsquo;s Steward, Falk Firebeard&mdash;you&rsquo;ll then find one of the Unusual Gems that pertain to the Thieves Guild Radiant Quest: No Stone Unturned.</p>
<p>Consult the quests chapters for more information.</p>
<p>Marriage Prospect: Jordis the Sword-Maiden [4/62]</p>
<p><em>Unusual Gem: [1/24]</em></p>
<h4>25) Addvar&rsquo;s House</h4>
<p><strong>Greta</strong><br /><strong>Svari</strong></p>
<p>This is the first of three terraced houses and flagged with a Shadowmark. Addvar the street vendor lives here. It&rsquo;s a small place, bordering on run-down. His wife, Greta, and daughter Svari live here with him.</p>
<p>Unlock the door (Novice), entering a modest home with a large amount of stored cheese and a cooking pot and chest. Upstairs is a small bedroom and second chest.</p>
<p><em>Shadowmark: &ldquo;Loot&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><em>Chest (2)</em></p>
