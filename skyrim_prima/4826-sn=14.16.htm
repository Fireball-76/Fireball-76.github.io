<h3>Major Spoilers</h3>
</div>
<p><strong>Prerequisites: </strong>Complete Dark Brotherhood Quest: Death Incarnate</p>
<p><strong>Intersecting Quests:</strong> Dark Brotherhood Quest: Death Incarnate, Dark Brotherhood Quest: Where You Hang Your Enemy&rsquo;s Head...</p>
<p><strong>Locations</strong>: Dark Brotherhood Sanctuary, East Empire Company Warehouse, Katariah, Volunruud , Whiterun, Bannered Mare</p>
<p><strong>Characters:</strong> Amaund Motierre, Babette, Nazir, The Night Mother</p>
<p><strong>Enemies</strong>: Captain Avidius, Commander Maro, Emperor Titus Mede II, Lieutenant Salvarus, Penitus Oculatus Agent, Sailor, Solitude Guard</p>
<p><strong>Objectives</strong>: Talk to Nazir, Talk to Amaund Motierre, Board the Katariah, (Optional) Kill Commander Maro, Kill the Emperor!, Report to Amaund Motierre, Retrieve the payment, (Optional) Kill Amaund Motierre, Report to Nazir</p>
<h4>Death to the Emperor</h4>
<div class="gameplay_image">
<div class="enlarge"><a target="_blank">Please click to enlarge</a></div>
<img src="db11-001.jpg" tppabs="http://www.primagames.com/games/media/files/skyrim/db11-001.jpg" border="0" width="437" /></div>
<p>This quest begins once you complete Dark Brotherhood Quest: Death Incarnate.</p>
<p><strong>Objective:</strong> Talk to Nazir</p>
<p>Only Nazir and Babette remain, as you come to grips with your Family&rsquo;s slaughter. Babette will follow Nazir&rsquo;s lead, so speak with him; he dejectedly believes this is the end for the Dark Brotherhood.</p>
<p>But tell him the Night Mother has spoken to you again, and the original contract must be carried out. You&rsquo;re to speak with Amaund Motierre, and the true Emperor must be assassinated.</p>
<div class="gameplay_image">
<div class="enlarge"><a target="_blank">Please click to enlarge</a></div>
<img src="db11-002.jpg" tppabs="http://www.primagames.com/games/media/files/skyrim/db11-002.jpg" border="0" width="437" /></div>
<p>While you muster a second attempt at regicide, Nazir recommends moving the Dark Brotherhood&rsquo;s Sanctuary to the one near Dawnstar, where you followed Cicero. You&rsquo;ll meet Nazir there afterward, ideally with a barrel full of gold.</p>
<p><strong>Objective:</strong> Talk to Amaund Motierre<br /><strong>Target</strong>: Amaund Motierre, Bannered Mare, in Whiterun</p>
<p>Amaund Motierre has taken up residence in the Bannered Mare, over in Whiterun. Travel there, and open the door to the room at the rear of the tavern. He&rsquo;s more than a little startled at your arrival, considering the news about the sacking of the Sanctuary.</p>
<p>He babbles about having nothing to do with the violence to your Family and still wants the Emperor dead. You are here to honor your contract, so ask him where the Emperor is.</p>
<p>Amaund tells you he&rsquo;s aboard his ship, the Katariah, now moored in the Solitude inlet. Upon your return after a successful assassination, Amaund will reveal the location of the dead drop that holds your payment.</p>
<p>Ask him additional questions (about security and getting aboard the ship) if you wish. Demanding to know where Commander Maro is nets you an optional objective.</p>
<p><strong>Objective:</strong> Board the Katariah<br /><strong>Target</strong>: Katariah ship, Solitude inlet</p>
<p><strong>Objective</strong>: (Optional) Kill Commander Maro<br /><strong>Target: </strong>Wharf of Solitude docks, near East Empire Company Warehouse</p>
<h4>(Optional) Additional Executions I</h4>
<div class="note&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Note&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;You may optionally kill Commander Maro at any point before the end of this quest, ideally before or after you assassinate the real Emperor.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Travel to Solitude&rsquo;s docks, close to the East Empire Company Warehouse, and search the wharf for the Commander. There&rsquo;s no time or point in talking; simply approach and kill him with a charge, sneak attack, long-range magic, or bow fire. Expect the nearby Solitude Guards to try and stop you. Fleeing the scene is usually the best option if you&rsquo;re spotted; the alternatives are to give up and go to jail or raise your bounty in this Hold considerably.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=">
<div class="enlarge"><a target="_blank">Please click to enlarge</a></div>
<img src="db11-003.jpg" tppabs="http://www.primagames.com/games/media/files/skyrim/db11-003.jpg" border="0" width="437" /></div>
<h4>Bringing Down an Empire</h4>
<p>Travel to Solitude&rsquo;s inlet, under the giant arch that the city rests upon, and locate the impressive galleon moored in the waters here. Swim alongside the vessel, dipping down underwater as you search for the anchor chain. Grab this, and haul yourself aboard the Katariah. You actually load into the cargo hold; don&rsquo;t climb the chain to the deck.</p>
<p><strong>Objective: </strong>Kill the Emperor!<br /><strong>Target:</strong> Emperor Titus Mede II, Emperor&rsquo;s Quarters, on the Katariah</p>
<div class="tip">
<h3>Tip</h3>
<p>The Katariah is anchored in the Solitude inlet when this quest began and remains here for the rest of your adventure. You may wish to give the ship a thorough search for valuable items. Consult the Atlas for the important areas to check.</p>
</div>
<p>You clamber into the hold of the Katariah, and your quest updates. At this point, your usual infiltration plans commence. You may explore this ship using magical augmentations that make you harder to see or the enemies less alert. You can also sneak (see below) or simply wade through and clobber anyone who gets it your way.</p>
<div class="gameplay_image">
<div class="enlarge"><a target="_blank">Please click to enlarge</a></div>
<img src="db11-004.jpg" tppabs="http://www.primagames.com/games/media/files/skyrim/db11-004.jpg" border="0" width="437" /></div>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need to return to this ship, so inspect every chamber for items you may wish to claim. Work your way south along the lower deck, into the large central dining galley. Climb the steps and expect more enemies as you reach the jail area. You&rsquo;re attacking both sailors and Penitus Oculatus Agents. This floor also has a small armory and dormitories; additional foes and items can be found here.</p>
<p>Your first critical foe to face is Captain Avidius, who is usually in his cabin by the storeroom and ladder. Kill (or pickpocket) them, and secure the Katariah Master Key from his corpse; this makes navigating the locked doors much more straightforward. Otherwise, you&rsquo;ll need extremely impressive Lockpick abilities.</p>
<div class="gameplay_image">
<div class="enlarge"><a target="_blank">Please click to enlarge</a></div>
<img src="db11-005.jpg" tppabs="http://www.primagames.com/games/media/files/skyrim/db11-005.jpg" border="0" width="437" /></div>
<p><em><strong>Items gained:</strong></em><br /><em>Katariah Master Key</em></p>
<p>The ladder up to the deck isn&rsquo;t necessary; instead, move north to the gold door that was locked previously (Expert), and open it&mdash;either with your Lockpick ability or the Key.</p>
<p>Repel the foes in this dormitory area, and sneak past or destroy Lieutenant Salvarus, who is stationed behind the gold door at the northern end of this floor. Climb up the nearby steps, and you&rsquo;re a room away from meeting the Emperor. The real one this time!</p>
<div class="tip">
<h3>Tip</h3>
<p>Sneaking to the Emperor&rsquo;s Quarters: From the initial room, follow the sailor as he meets his friend and wanders into the galley. When they enter, wait for another sailor to exit from the barracks at the hall&rsquo;s end, and head into the galley as well. Now wait for the guard to move away from the bar, and then sneak around to the chamber&rsquo;s right side. The bard with the flute moves out of the way, allowing a clear path to the stairs. At the top of the stairs, pick the locked door (Expert). You don&rsquo;t have to deal with the captain or the two soldiers in the central room!</p>
</div>
<div class="tip">
<h3>Tip</h3>
<p>Further Fighting: If you&rsquo;re in the mood for more combat, use the ladder up to the trapdoor near Captain Avidius&rsquo;s cabin, or the gold door opposite the door to the Emperor&rsquo;s Quarters. Exit out onto the Katariah&rsquo;s exterior deck. Here, you can slice into the Emperor&rsquo;s agents if you wish. This is one option as an escape route, too. If you want to avoid fighting the captain, you can sneak across the deck. It&rsquo;s much harder (try it at night), but you can go this way if you want to.</p>
</div>
<p>Approach the door to the Emperor&rsquo;s Quarters (Master). This requires an impressive Lockpick or the use of the Katariah Master Key. (If you didn&rsquo;t get it from the captain, Lieutenant Salvarus downstairs has another.) Step forward, and the Emperor greets you: Not with a blade or a string of curses but with a well-mannered speech. He knew Commander Maro to be a fool; one cannot stop the Dark Brotherhood!</p>
<div class="gameplay_image">
<div class="enlarge"><a target="_blank">Please click to enlarge</a></div>
<img src="db11-006.jpg" tppabs="http://www.primagames.com/games/media/files/skyrim/db11-006.jpg" border="0" width="437" /></div>
<p><strong>You can:</strong></p>
<p>Execute the Emperor immediately.</p>
<p>Or speak with him and give him a moment to say a few words before you run him through. He asks for a favor. Not as part of a Black Sacrament, but as an old man&rsquo;s dying wish. There is one who set this assassination forth, and the Emperor wants him punished for his treachery. You are to kill that person. You need not commit to this deed. Now the Emperor turns and waits for death. Oblige him.</p>
<p><em><strong>Items gained:</strong></em><br /><em>Emperor&rsquo;s Robes</em></p>
<p><em>Katariah Master Key</em></p>
<p><strong>Objective:</strong> Report to Amaund Motierre<br /><strong>Target:</strong> Amaund Motierre, Bannered Mare, in Whiterun</p>
<p>Ransack the Emperor&rsquo;s Quarters for any books or other items you wish; the Emperor&rsquo;s chest in his bedroom has some good loot. Leave via the door in the northeast wall that leads to an exterior balcony, allowing you to dive into the waters and swim to safety, or backtrack and enter the deck, if you want more fighting.</p>
<p>Whatever your route, travel back to Whiterun, enter the Bannered Mare once again. Speak with Amaund, and inform him that Titus Mede II lies dead. Amaund has just heard this information himself and is extremely pleased: As you shall be; there is a considerable payment inside an urn, in the chamber where you first met, back in Volunruud. Amaund wants you to leave now and never cross paths with him again.</p>
<p><strong>Objective:</strong> Retrieve the payment<br /><strong>Target</strong>: Urn, in Volunruud</p>
<p><strong>Objective:</strong> (Optional) Kill Amaund Motierre</p>
<p><strong>(Optional)</strong> Additional Executions II</p>
<p>If you wish to kill Amaund and honor the Emperor&rsquo;s wishes, you can tell him there&rsquo;s just one more matter to clear up and then tell him you&rsquo;re doing a favor for an honorable man. Or, you can choose to answer him differently (or remain silent) and attack him anyway!</p>
<div class="gameplay_image">
<div class="enlarge"><a target="_blank">Please click to enlarge</a></div>
<img src="db11-008.jpg" tppabs="http://www.primagames.com/games/media/files/skyrim/db11-008.jpg" border="0" width="437" /></div>
<p>Turn your blade into him and dispatch this aloof traitor (grab his pocketful of gems). Your bounty in Whiterun skyrockets, so expect Guards to confront you moments after the murder.</p>
<h4>Quest Conclusion</h4>
<p>Amaund Motierre lived up to his part of the bargain; travel to Volunruud, dismantle any skeletal foes that greet you, and search the initial room where you met previously. Inside the urn is a considerable sum of gold!</p>
<p><em><strong>Items gained:</strong></em><br /><em>20,000 gold pieces</em></p>
<p><strong>Objective:</strong> Report to Nazir<br /><strong>Target:</strong> Nazir, Dawnstar Sanctuary</p>
<p>Now journey to the Darkstar Sanctuary and approach the Black Door. The door opens, allowing you down into the main chamber with the smashed circular window and large fireplace. Nazir is waiting for word on the Emperor.</p>
<p>Inform him that you&rsquo;ve done the deed, and tell him how much gold you were paid as a reward. You can be truthful or lie (it doesn&rsquo;t matter). Nazir recommends you go to Riften and search out a man named Delvin Mallory, someone Astrid already had you visit previously.</p>
<p>This time, though, the &ldquo;obtainer of goods&rdquo; will refit this Sanctuary, using the money you earned, and make a true home for this Family once again.</p>
<h4>Postquest Activities</h4>
<p>Dark Brotherhood Quest: Where You Hang Your Enemy&rsquo;s Head... begins immediately, along with additional quests.</p>
<h3>Where You Hang Your Enemy&rsquo;s Head...</h3>
<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Complete Dark Brotherhood Quest: Hail Sithis!</p>
<p><strong>Intersecting Quests:</strong> Dark Brotherhood Quest: Hail Sithis!</p>
<p><strong>Locations:</strong> Dawnstar Sanctuary, Riften , The Ratway, The Ragged Flagon</p>
<p><strong>Characters:</strong> Babette , Cicero , Delvin Mallory , Nazir</p>
<p><strong>Enemies:</strong> None</p>
<p><strong>Objective:</strong> Employ Delvin Mallory&rsquo;s services</p>
<h4>That&rsquo;s Your Home</h4>
<p>This quest begins once you complete Dark Brotherhood Quest: Hail Sithis!</p>
<p><strong>Objective:</strong> Employ Delvin Mallory&rsquo;s services</p>
<p>Nazir says that you can use the large haul of gold you received from your previous quest to modify the Dawnstar Sanctuary. If you spend the funds on this place rather than on yourself and your inventory, set off to Riften and follow the Ratway to the Ragged Flagon, where the Thieves Guild members reside.</p>
<p>You may run into Cicero as you exit the Dawnstar Sanctuary for the first time after Nazir and Babette move there. Consult the Dark Brotherhood Radiant Quests: Cicero&rsquo;s Return for more details.</p>
<p>Find Delvin and ask if he can repair and refit the Dawnstar Sanctuary. He says it will cost you, but he can help. Spruce up the place with any of the possible repairs:</p>
