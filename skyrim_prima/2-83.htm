						<h4><em></em>5) Temple of Mara</h4>
<div class="gameplay_image">

<img src="jpg/sr_atlas/sr_atlas_9a-003.jpg" tppabs="http://www.primagames.com/games/elder-scrolls-v-skyrim/media/files/skyrim/jpg/sr_atlas/sr_atlas_9a-003.jpg" border="0"  /></div>
<p><strong>Maramal</strong><br /> <strong>Dinya Balu</strong></p>
<p>The  Temple of Mara offers services to the people of Riften and is     devoted  to the worship of Mara, one of the Nine Divines and the     recognized  goddess of love.</p>
<p>It is here that weddings are held (Side  Quest: The Bonds of     Matrimony). You can get a Blessing at the altar or  at two smaller     shrines on either side of the main chamber.</p>
<p>The  first Note is from Anuriel warning of disturbances in the Hall   of   the  Dead. The second Note is from Talen-Jei, regarding his   forthcoming    wedding. The cellar has some food and drink, and an   entrance to the   Hall  of the Dead.<br /> <em><strong></strong></em></p>
<p><em>Unique Item: The Bond of Matrimony [80/112]</em><br /> <em>Shrine of Mara [5/5]</em><br /> <em>Note: Reports of a Disturbance</em><br /> <em>Note: Argonian Ceremony</em><br /> <em>Potions</em></p>
<h4>6) Hall of the Dead</h4>
<p><strong>Alessandra</strong></p>
<p>The Riften Hall of the Dead  has two levels, underneath the Temple of     Mara. The ground floor serves  as a Shrine of Arkay; the bottom,     underground level is actually a  series of catacombs that contain some   of   Riften&rsquo;s most important dead.</p>
<p>Connected  to the mausoleum is a graveyard, containing even more of     the city&rsquo;s  departed. There are two entrances: from the outside under   the   Temple  of Mara balcony and via the cellar inside the Temple.</p>
<p>Inside, there are numerous skeletons from which you can remove a few coins, bone meal, and skulls.<br /> <em></em></p>
<p><em>Unique Weapon: Alessandra&rsquo;s Dagger [62/80]</em><br /> <em>Shrine of Arkay [12/12]</em></p>
<h4>B) The Ragged Flagon: Cistern Entrance</h4>
<p>The secret entrance to the Ragged Flagon, Cistern, becomes available      during the Thieves Guild Quest: Loud and Clear and becomes a world   map    marker (making it simple to return to the Guild).</p>
<p>It can&rsquo;t  be opened until then but provides a quicker return route to     Brynjolf  and Mercer Frey, instead of navigating the Ratway. Note  the    Shadowmark  on the coffin (which you press to open) and on the     surrounding Hall  of the Dead entrance walls.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re exiting from the Cistern, use the pull chain to open the coffin.<br /> <em>Shadowmark: &ldquo;The Guild&rdquo;</em></p>
<h4>7) Black-Briar Manor</h4>
<p>Maven Black-Briar (Imperial Jarl)<br /> Hemming Black-Briar (Imperial Steward)<br /> Sibbi Black-Briar<br /> Ingun Black-Briar</p>
<p>Black-Briar  Manor is the home of the Black-Briar family, the     wealthiest, most  powerful family in all of Riften. The Black-Briar     family are the  owners of the Black-Briar Meadery, and as such control     much of  Riften&rsquo;s economy.</p>
<p>It is accessed via the front door (note the Shadowmark), a leap over the garden fence, and through the back gate (Expert).</p>
<p>Inside,  the foyer end table has a Note regarding the loss of a mead     shipment,  and the rest of the ground floor has a dining table full  of    food and  other stored items.<br /> <em></em></p>
<p><em>Shadowmark: &ldquo;Protected&rdquo;</em><br /> <em>Note: Regarding your Loss</em><br /> <em>Potions</em></p>
<p>Cellar:  There are three doors, two of which are unlocked. One leads     to a  small bedroom. One leads to a larger bedroom with an Alchemy  Lab    and a  number of ingredients to steal.</p>
<p>The third door (Expert)  leads to a tiny chamber where the Black     Sacrament has been performed.  There is a letter from Maven here; she is     unhappy with Astrid (from  the Dark Brotherhood) about the lack of    action  regarding an  assassination Maven requested!<br /> <em></em></p>
<p><em>Crafting: Alchemy Lab</em><br /> <em>Note: To the Brotherhood</em><br /> <em>Potions</em></p>
<p>Upper  Floor: Check the shelves in the hallway for a book on the     Gaulder  legends. On the bedside table are two letters, each containing a      different tone from two business acquaintances. There is an exit   onto    an upper exterior balcony (a quick escape if need be!).<br /> <em></em></p>
<p><em>Business Letters (2)</em><br /> <em>Chest</em></p>
<h4>8) Shrine of Talos</h4>
<p><strong>Nura Snow-Shod</strong></p>
<p>Talos is worshipped openly  when the Stormcloaks are in control of   the   city. When they are not,  the shrine has less of a presence. Nura     Snow-Shod is usually found  here during the day, tending the Shrine.<br /> Shrine of Talos [16/17]</p>
<h4>9) Dead Gate</h4>
<p>The Dead Gate is so named for the number of people who died there      thanks to repeated bandit raids of the city. The gate is now completely      boarded up and no longer in use.</p>
<h4>10) Mistveil Keep</h4>
<div class="gameplay_image">

<img src="jpg/sr_atlas/sr_atlas_9a-004.jpg" tppabs="http://www.primagames.com/games/elder-scrolls-v-skyrim/media/files/skyrim/jpg/sr_atlas/sr_atlas_9a-004.jpg" border="0"  /></div>
<p>The following leaders of Riften are loyal to the Stormcloaks at the start of the Civil War.<br /> <strong>Jarl Laila Law-Giver</strong></p>
<p>Laila  is a fervent supporter of the Stormcloaks, strongly believing     that  the Empire can do nothing but steal the heritage of their city   away   if  they come to power.</p>
<p>She firmly believes in the old ways of Skyrim and is steeped in its traditions and mannerisms.</p>
<p>Even  though she rules quite a corrupt city, she is blissfully   unaware   of  the more nefarious goings-on in town thanks to her   Steward,  Anuriel,   who has been known to accept bribes and payoffs   from the  seedier   inhabitants of Riften.<br /> <strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Harrald</strong></p>
<p>Harrald  is the youngest son of Laila Law-Giver. He is largely     indifferent to  the events of the Civil War but sides with the     Stormcloaks because his  mother does. This situation has driven a wedge     between Saerlund and  Harrald, who constantly chide each other for   their   stances on the  situation.<br /> <strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Saerlund</strong></p>
<p>Saerlund  is the oldest son of Laila Law-Giver. When he publicly   spoke   in favor  of the Imperial forces in the Civil War, Laila refused   to   recognize  him as heir.</p>
<p>There is a great deal of hostility between the   two  now, although   Saerlund still lives in the Keep. Should Laila ever    become exiled due   to the Empire gaining control of Riften, Saerlund will    remain  behind  and live in the Keep in defiance of his mother&rsquo;s   beliefs.<br /> <strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Anuriel (Steward)</strong></p>
<p>Anuriel&rsquo;s  devotion to her Jarl is a guise for her true nature as a     corrupt and  greedy individual. She readily accepts bribes from     influential people  in the city and is extremely clever at covering her     tracks (even if it  means making loose ends disappear).</p>
<p>She has no desire to  actually become the Jarl, seeing her position   as   a stronger link to  her corrupt ties. She has gained some   reputation as   someone not to be  trifled with.<br /> <strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Unmid Snow-Shod (Housecarl)</strong></p>
<p>Unmid  is the second to youngest child of Vulwulf Snow-Shod. He has      dedicated his life to the art of combat, becoming highly adept at all      sorts of martial weaponry.</p>
<p>Due to this incredible talent, he  was hired as the Housecarl. On   more   than one occasion, Unmid has  proved he cannot be bested in   combat and   has even put down several  attempts on the Jarl&rsquo;s life.   Unmid&rsquo;s single   weakness is his  infatuation for Anuriel, the Jarl&rsquo;s   Steward.<br /> <strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Wylandriah (Court Wizard)</strong></p>
<p>She  spends most of her day in her laboratory performing experiments     and  only makes herself available to the Jarl when specifically   summoned.    She seems always scatterbrained, but this is an act, as   Wylandriah    would prefer to be doing her experimentation rather than   matters of    court.</p>
<p>By acting this way, she believes people leave her to herself most of the time (which is true).<br /> <strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Gonnar Oath-Giver</strong></p>
<p>The following residents of Riften arrive to take control of this city, once this Hold has fallen during the Civil War.</p>
<p><strong>Maven Black-Briar, Imperial Jarl</strong></p>
<p>As  matron of the Black-Briar family and a powerful businesswoman,     Maven  is virtually unapproachable and elitist. She&rsquo;s cold, ruthless  and     calculating&mdash;and also well connected within the Empire and Skyrim   alike.</p>
<p>If the Empire takes control of Riften in the Civil War, Maven    (thanks  to  powerful friends in Cyrodiil) is installed as the Imperial    Jarl. She   will also fill her court with family and allies.</p>
<p><strong>Hemming Black-Briar, Imperial Steward</strong></p>
<p>Hemming  Black-Briar is the only son of Maven Black-Briar, and heir   to   family  fortune. He is being groomed by Maven as a sort of   prot&eacute;g&eacute;...   someone  to eventually take her place not only running the   Meadery, but   to also  dabble in the same corrupt activities.</p>
<p>Hemming is often an  errand-boy, and has come to admire his mother&rsquo;s     ways and fervently  defends her whenever a family squabble should   arise.<br /> <strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Maul (Housecarl)</strong></p>
<p>Maul  is a close friend of Hemming Black-Briar; when he was ambushed     by  bandits, Maul dove into the fray to save him. Ever since then,   they    have been partners in crime, with Maul assisting Hemming in his   more    nefarious activities assigned by Maven Black-Briar.</p>
<p>He does  not live within Riften, as he wants his identity to remain     anonymous.  Maul&rsquo;s brother is Dirge, part of the security at the  Ragged    Flagon.</p>
<h4>Mistveil Keep (Exterior)</h4>
<p>This ominous stone keep is where Jarl Laila Law-Giver lives and      rules, but this important building also contains the city&rsquo;s jail and      barracks. The barracks are to your left (southeast) and the jail to the      right (southwest) of the main door into the Keep, with the banners  on     each side.</p>
<p>This is where the majority of the city&rsquo;s guards reside.</p>
<h4>Mistveil Keep (Interior)</h4>
<p>Banquet Hall and Throne Room: Guards, the Jarl, and her entourage are      seated here. There&rsquo;s enough food here to feed a small army.<br /> <em></em></p>
<p><em>Chest (2)</em><br /> Wylandriah&rsquo;s Enchantments: The Court Wizard   can usually be found    here, in this two-room chamber off the Banquet   Hall, which houses her    shop and bed.<br /> <em>Crafting: Alchemy Lab, Arcane Enchanter</em><br /> <em>Trader (Spell Vendor): Wylandriah [12/12]</em><br /> <em>Weapons, Apparel, Scrolls, Books, Misc</em><br /> <em>Chest</em><br /> <em>Potions aplenty</em><br /> <em>Loose gear</em></p>
<p>War  Room and Armory: Gonnar Oath-Giver is plotting from this   location    (which was once a pantry) at the start of the Civil War.   Open one door    to head into the Barracks, and open the other into a   bedroom armory    filled with weapons.<br /> <em><strong></strong></em></p>
<p><em>Civil War: Map of Skyrim</em><br /> <em>Chest</em><br /> <em>Loose gear</em></p>
<p>Anuriel&rsquo;s  Room: Located at the far end of the ground-floor corridor,     this room  has a number of precious gems and necklaces and a letter     regarding the  imprisonment of Sibbi Black-Briar. Head to this  location    during the  Civil War Quest: Compelling Tribute (Imperials).<br /> <em></em></p>
<p><em>Note: Sibbi Black-Briar</em><br /> <em>Chest</em></p>
<h4>Mistveil Keep Jarl&rsquo;s Quarters</h4>
<p>There are three doors at the top of the stairs, each leading to a      bedroom. Check for the following, and a door from the Jarl&rsquo;s bedroom to  a     covered balcony offering views of Riften:<br /> <em></em></p>

<h4>Mistveil Keep Barracks (Exterior)</h4>
<p>A large yard where guards (and sometimes Harrald) come to practice.<br /> Mistveil Keep Barracks (Interior)<br /> A large number of guards (and mead bottles) are inside this two-floor      structure. The Riften Guards are well equipped and numerous. The  lower     exits lead out to the training yard and into Mistveil Keep.  The  upper    exit leads out onto crenellations above the yard.<br /> <em></em></p>

<h4>Riften Jail</h4>
<p><strong>Threki </strong><br /> <strong>Sibbi Black-Briar</strong><br /> <strong>Molgrom Twice-Killed</strong></p>
<p>A jailor stops you from heading into the jail if you&rsquo;re visiting, unless you can persuade or bribe your way past him.</p>
<p>Inside,  you can find the jail office on the right, with the evidence     room  just beyond; both are a bit of a mess. Note the sewer wall   opening    close to the chests, though you can&rsquo;t do anything with it   from this    side.</p>
<p>The cells are on two separate levels, with Sibbi  Black-Briar and     Threki the Innocent imprisoned on the top floor and  Molgrom   Twice-Killed   on the lower level. All of the cell doors are  locked   (Adept).</p>
<p>A Skill Book sits atop a barrel in a dark nook above the stairs.</p>
<p>If  you get imprisoned here, you can pick the lock on your cell door     and  sneak out&mdash;just keep an eye on the patrolling guard and time your      movements to slip by them.</p>
<p>Or better yet, note the Shadowmark and the broken shackle on the wall in your cell.</p>
<p>Pull  the shackle and a secret passage in the wall creaks open!   Escape    through this sealed-off section of the Ratway, which is filled   with    debris, and push open the sewer grate to retrieve your   belongings from    the evidence room.</p>
<p>Then head down the passage into a section  of unexplored sewers.   Fight   any Skeevers you see, check the flooded  area for a chest, and   continue   through the hatch into a second section  of sewers.</p>
<p>Follow the rushing water to the exit, which leads  you out to the   edge   of Lake Honrich, near the South Gate and Riften  Warehouse: the   Sewer   Gate [G].</p>
<p>Note that you can only escape this way once: after doing so,   the guards seal the passage and remove the shackle.<br /> <em></em></p>

<h4>C) South Gate</h4>
<p>The Riften South Gate, set into the city&rsquo;s southern wall, sees its      fair share of traffic, but not nearly as much as that of the Main Gate      to the north.</p>
<h4>11) Honorhall Orphanage</h4>
<p><strong>Grelod the Kind</strong><br /> <strong>Constance Michel</strong><br /> <strong>Francois Beaufort</strong><br /> <strong>Samuel</strong><br /> <strong>Runa Fair-Shield</strong><br /> <strong>Hroar</strong></p>
<p>The  Honorhall Orphanage is home to several orphaned young boys and     girls  whose parents have been lost to anything from fishing  accidents,    to  battle, to the general harshness of life.</p>
<p>The institution is  privately funded by Maven Black-Briar. The     interior is on a single  floor. Enter via the dining room and pantry. A     side bedroom has a  Skill</p>
<p><em>Book by the bed.</em></p>
<p>Through the main  dormitory (with three empty chests) where the     orphans sleep is a small  room with child-sized shackles and Grelod&rsquo;s     office. There are also  doors leading to a small garden, which is more   of   a prison yard.</p>
