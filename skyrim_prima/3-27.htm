<h4 style="font-size: 1em;">19) Skyforge and the Underforge</h4>
<div class="gameplay_image">
<div class="enlarge"><a target="_blank">Please click to enlarge</a></div>
<img src="jpg/sr_atlas/sr_atlas_6a-010.jpg" tppabs="http://www.primagames.com/games/elder-scrolls-v-skyrim/media/files/skyrim/jpg/sr_atlas/sr_atlas_6a-010.jpg" border="0" width="437" /></div>
<p>The Skyforge is the great forge used by Eorlund Gray-Mane to craft his masterful weapons, shields, and armor. It got its name due to the fact that it&rsquo;s a large, ancient forge, located outside on a mountain, close to the sky. The forge is large, and unlike most forges is rather ornate. It is in the shape on an eagle, with wings spreading out from each side. Eorlund is happy to train and trade his wares with you, but only after you join the Companions.</p>
<p><em>Crafting: Skyforge, Grindstone<br />Trader (Blacksmith): Eorlund Gray-Mane [18/33]<br />Weapons, Apparel, and Misc<br />Trainer (Smithing: Master): Eorlund Gray-Mane [2/3]<br />Skill Book [Smithing]: The Armorer&rsquo;s Challenge<br />Unique Weapon: Wuuthrad [40/80]</em></p>
<p>Underneath the Skyforge is a hidden area known as the Underforge, where those welcomed into the Circle of the Companions observe a special blood ritual. This is only accessible during the Companions quest line. You can return here to deliver or utilize Totems.</p>
<h4>20) House Gray-Mane</h4>
<p><em>Olfina the Golden</em><br /><em>Avulstein Gray-Mane</em></p>
<p>House Gray-Mane is the residence of Eorlund Gray-Mane and his  children. It is a large, solid house, built by Eorlund over 35 years  earlier. Recently, due to their differing stances on the Civil War, Clan  Gray-Mane has bad relations with Clan Battle-Born, with whom they had  always been friendly before the conflict started.</p>
<p>Jon Battle-Born and Olfina the Golden are said to be in love, but the  families certainly do not approve of such activities. Outside the house  is a small paddock with a cow. Inside the house is a central fire pit  and dining area, with a small entrance alcove and Avulstein&rsquo;s bedroom.  Upstairs is a landing and two bedrooms with some books and valuables  (usually necklaces) lying around.</p>
<p><em>Shadowmark: &ldquo;Loot&rdquo;<br />Chest (4)</em></p>
<h4>21) Uthgerd&rsquo;s House</h4>
<p>This is the house belonging to the violent Nord warmaiden that  challenges you to fisticuffs in the Bannered Mare. Her home is locked,  but once inside, is full of Nord pottery, a chest, and a small book  collection in a nook under the stairs. Upstairs is an empty chest and a  full display case.</p>
<p><em>Chest<br />Loose gear</em></p>
<h4>22) Amren&rsquo;s House</h4>
<p><em>Amren</em><br /><em>Braith</em></p>
<p>Amren&rsquo;s House is attached to Uthgerd&rsquo;s. Amren is usually walking  around the Wind District. His wife, Saffir, and daughter Braith may be  inside the dwelling. There&rsquo;s very little worth stealing here.</p>
<p><em>Shadowmark: &ldquo;Danger&rdquo;</em><br /><em>Trainer (One-Handed: Journeyman): Amren [2/3]</em></p>
<h4>23) Carlotta Valentia&rsquo;s House</h4>
<p><em>Mila Valentia</em></p>
<p>Carlotta Valentia lives in this house with her young daughter Mila.  Find a couple of potions in one of the upstairs bedrooms, along with a  Skill Book that&rsquo;s tucked between the bed and end table.</p>
<p><em>Shadowmark: &ldquo;Loot&rdquo;<br />Skill Book [Enchanting]: Enchanter&rsquo;s Primer [D2/10]</em></p>
<h4>24) House of Clan Battle-Born</h4>
<p><em>Olfrid Battle-Born</em><br /><em>Bergritte Battle-Born</em><br /><em>Idolaf Battle-Born</em><br /><em>Jon Battle-Born</em><br /><em>Alfhild Battle-Born</em><br /><em>Lars Battle-Born</em></p>
<p>This large house holds three generations of the equally large Clan  Battle-Born. This warrior family&mdash;owners of the Battle-Born Farm outside  Whiterun&mdash;has lived in the city for centuries; their ties to Skyrim and  the ancient Nord ways cannot be disputed.</p>
<p>The Clan has come out vocally in support of the pro-Imperial forces  in the ongoing Civil War. Recently, due to their differing stances on  the Civil War, Clan Battle-Born has bad relations with Clan Gray-Mane,  with whom they had always been friendly before the conflict started.</p>
<p>The rear door is usually unlocked, while the front door isn&rsquo;t  (Novice). Inside, the ground floor is one large chamber with a cooking  spit and dining table dominating the area.</p>
<p>To the northwest is Olfrid&rsquo;s bedroom, which has some valuables on  display (including a Skill Book) and a locked door (Adept) leading to a  small office with books and an Imperial Missive, useful during Side  Quest: Missing in Action. On the opposite side is a small bedroom with  books to check, stairs up to the balcony, and two more bedrooms.</p>
<p><em>Shadowmark: &ldquo;Protected&rdquo;<br />Imperial Missive<br />Skill Book [Two-Handed]: Battle of Sancre Tor<br />Potions</em></p>
<h4>25) Hall of the Dead</h4>
<p><em>Andurs</em></p>
<p>The Whiterun Hall of the Dead is a single-story, high-ceilinged  wooden structure and serves as Whiterun&rsquo;s mausoleum. The main floor has  the sleeping quarters for Andurs (with a large collection of books and  small collection of skulls) and a shrine to Arkay where the people of  Whiterun can come and worship. Check one of the wall crypts to find an  Unusual Gem lying near the foot of a skeleton&mdash;this pertains to Side  Quest: No Stone Unturned.</p>
<p><em>Unique Item: Andurs&rsquo; Amulet of Arkay [58/112]<br />Unusual Gem: [12/24]<br />Shrine of Arkay [7/12]<br />Chest</em></p>
<h4>Whiterun Catacombs</h4>
<p>These catacombs contain generations of Whiterun&rsquo;s dead, including the  bodies of some of Skyrim&rsquo;s most honored departed&mdash;and not quite  departed. There is also graveyard outside.</p>

<h3>Cloud District</h3>
<div class="gameplay_image">
<div class="enlarge"><a target="_blank">Please click to enlarge</a></div>
<img src="jpg/sr_atlas/sr_atlas_6a-011.jpg" tppabs="http://www.primagames.com/games/elder-scrolls-v-skyrim/media/files/skyrim/jpg/sr_atlas/sr_atlas_6a-011.jpg" border="0" width="437" /></div>
<p>The Cloud District is the smallest of Whiterun&rsquo;s three districts. It  was so named because it is located atop the mountain Whiterun was built  on and is therefore closer to the clouds than any other. It is dominated  by the imposing form of Dragonsreach.</p>
<h4>26) Dragonsreach</h4>
<div class="gameplay_image">
<div class="enlarge"><a target="_blank">Please click to enlarge</a></div>
<img src="jpg/sr_atlas/sr_atlas_6a-012.jpg" tppabs="http://www.primagames.com/games/elder-scrolls-v-skyrim/media/files/skyrim/jpg/sr_atlas/sr_atlas_6a-012.jpg" border="0" width="437" /></div>
<p>The following leaders of Whiterun are loyal to the Imperials at the start of the Civil War.</p>
<p><strong>Jarl Balgruuf the Greater</strong></p>
<p>Balgruuf believes that Skyrim should remain a part of the Empire.  This has become something of a confusing situation for the people of  Skyrim, many of whom are decidedly anti-Empire. Balgruuf embodies the  very best of what it is to be a Nord, but at the same time he supports  the Empire&rsquo;s presence.</p>
<p>This has actually caused some of these same anti-Empire residents of  Whiterun to at least reconsider their thinking. After all, if Balgruuf  the Greater supports the Empire, then maybe they are the key to Skyrim&rsquo;s  future. Balgruuf is very close to his younger brother Hrongar.</p>
<p><strong>Hrongar</strong></p>
<p>Hrongar is Balgruuf&rsquo;s younger brother and is something of a  warmonger. He believes his brother should organize Imperial forces and  wipe out any Stormcloaks presence in Whiterun Hold. Hrongar divides his  time among a few activities, most notably advising (and sometimes  arguing with) his brother Balgruuf and practicing with his sword and axe  against the town guard.</p>
<p><em>Frothar<br />Dagny<br />Nelkir<br /></em></p>
<p><strong>Farengar Secret-Fire (Court Wizard)</strong></p>
<p>Farengar serves the Jarl because of duty, but Farengar has no  interest in the Civil War and certainly has no love for the Empire. He  is dedicated to the College of Winterhold and furthering the cause of  magical research. So as long as he is able to maintain his laboratory  and keep up his research, he really doesn&rsquo;t care what the Jarl believes.</p>
<p><strong>Proventus Avenicci (Steward)</strong></p>
<p>Proventus essentially tells Balgruuf whatever he wants to hear and is  a politician through and through. In other words, Proventus is  completely inept as a Steward. The only reason he&rsquo;s been able to achieve  any manner of success and keep his position is because his daughter  Adrianne is tactically brilliant and has been telling her father what to  tell the Jarl.</p>
<p><strong>Irileth (Housecarl)</strong></p>
<p>Irileth is unusual for a Housecarl: She&rsquo;s female, a Dark Elf, and  doesn&rsquo;t fit the role of muscle-bound protector. But that doesn&rsquo;t make  her any less effective. Irileth is actually a skilled assassin, trained  in Morrowind by the Morag Tong. She met Balgruuf several years prior and  the two became fast friends and adventuring companions.</p>
<p><strong>Commander Caius</strong></p>
<p>The following residents arrive to take control of Whiterun, should this Hold fall during the Civil War.</p>
<p><strong>Jarl Vignar Gray-Mane</strong></p>
<p>Vignar was once a general and commander in the Legion during the  Great War. He came to Whiterun to retire and be near his brother, the  renowned smith Eorlund Gray-Mane. Because of his long experience as a  soldier, Vignar holds a place of honor among the Companions, and the  group welcomes his council. In the course of the Civil War, Vignar  shifted loyalties to his home. He is angry at the Empire for  surrendering to the Dominion and feels that Skyrim would be better off  on its own, as in the ancient times. When the Stormcloaks control  Whiterun, they call on Vignar&rsquo;s experience and wisdom to lead the city  as its Jarl.</p>
<p><strong>Brill (Steward)</strong></p>
<p>Brill was once an adventurer who was injured by a Draugr axe a number  of years ago. This brush with death left him shaken and broken. He took  to drinking, spending much time and coin in the Bannered Mare. It was  there he met Vignar, who he befriended. Vignar took Brill into his home,  and he&rsquo;s never left.</p>
<p><strong>Olfina Gray-Mane (Housecarl)</strong></p>
<p>When Vignar is called upon to serve as Whiterun&rsquo;s Jarl, he names his  niece Olfina as his Housecarl. Willful and determined, Olfina accepts  the honorable duty and swears to defend her uncle&rsquo;s life with her own.</p>
<p><strong>Sinmir</strong></p>
<p>Dragonsreach is Whiterun&rsquo;s majestic keep. It was constructed in the  ornate wooden style of the great Nord longhouses of old. Visually and  politically, it is very much the focal point of the city. As is true of  the keeps in other cities, Dragonsreach serves many important functions.  There is an ornate bridge leading to the main double doors. Around to  the side is an entrance to Dragonsreach Dungeon.</p>

<h4>A) Door to Whiterun</h4>
<h4>1) Great Hall</h4>
<p>The great hall is the main chamber of the keep and is where the Jarl  holds court on his throne beyond the long tables and central fire pit.  Check the shelves to the sides for all manner of books. There are  balconies on the upper floor, accessed via the War Room, from which you  can peer down.</p>
<h4>2) Kitchens</h4>
<p>Two large tables and an even bigger fireplace are where the Jarl&rsquo;s servants prepare the feasts of the long table.</p>
<h4>3) Servant&rsquo;s Bedroom and Storage (Lower)</h4>
<p>A rough-hewed, rock-walled chamber where the servant sleeps. There is a storage room behind the door.</p>
<h4>B) Door to Jarl&rsquo;s Quarters</h4>
<h4>C) Old Wooden Door (Requires Key)</h4>
<p>This odd door seems sealed from the other side. Consult Side Quest: The Whispering Door for more information.</p>
<h4>4) Farengar&rsquo;s Quarters</h4>
<p>In this laboratory, the Court Wizard Farengar mixes concoctions and  conducts research into the mysteries of the dragons&rsquo; return. His bedroom  and a small library are behind his main study.</p>
<p><em>Crafting: Alchemy Lab, Arcane Enchanter<br />Trader (Spell Vendor): Farengar Secret-Fire [10/12]<br />Apparel, Scrolls, Books, Misc<br />Potions<br />Loose gear</em></p>
<h4>5) War Room</h4>
<p>This is where the Jarl and his advisors discuss matters of state,  pouring over the Civil War map near the book-lined shelves. When needed,  an Imperial Legate also plans from this location.</p>
<p><em>Civil War: Map of Skyrim<br />Display Case (Apprentice)<br />Loose gear</em></p>
<h4>D) Door to Jarl&rsquo;s Quarters</h4>
<h4>E) Door to Dragonsreach, Great Porch</h4>
<p>Enter the Great Porch if you want an impressive view to the east.  Legend has it that a dragon was trapped here, on this porch. Perhaps  history might repeat itself? Consult the Main Quest for further  information.</p>
<h4>Dragonsreach Jarl&rsquo;s Quarters</h4>
<p>This is the private quarters of the Jarl, and entering here without  invitation results in you being removed, facing a fine, or worse.  However, a special gem can be found here that pertains to Side Quest: No  Stone Unturned.</p>
<p><em>Unique Weapon: Ebony Blade [41/80]</em><br /><em>Unusual Gem: [13/24]</em></p>
<h4>D) Door to Dragonsreach</h4>
<h4>6) Inner Hall and Staircase</h4>
<p><em>Display Cases (Apprentice) (3)<br />Display Case (Master)<br />Loose gear</em></p>
<h4>7) Proventus Avenicci&rsquo;s Chamber</h4>
<p>Note the display case; it usually has something valuable inside.</p>
<p><em>Display Case (Adept)</em><br /><em>Chest</em></p>
<h4>8) Servant&rsquo;s Quarters</h4>
<p>Fianna and Gerda usually rest here, in the tiny alcove bedrooms off the main food storage and wine vat area.</p>
<p><em>Chest</em></p>
<h4>B) Door to Dragonsreach</h4>
<h4>9) Childrens&rsquo; Bedroom</h4>
<p>The Jarl&rsquo;s three children, Nelkir, Dagny, and Frothar, sleep here.</p>
<p><em>Chest (3)</em></p>
<h4>10) Hrongar&rsquo;s Bedroom</h4>
<p>The Jarl&rsquo;s brother sleeps here. The study desk has shelves with books on them.</p>
<h4>11) Jarl&rsquo;s Bedchamber</h4>
<p>There are three connected chambers here: a dining area, bedroom, and book-filled study.</p>
<p><em>Skill Book [Illusion]: Before the Ages of Man [B1/10]<br />Loose gear</em></p>
<h4>F) Door to Whiterun</h4>
<p>Exit onto a narrow parapet balcony and overlook the entirety of Whiterun.</p>
<h4>Dragonsreach Dungeon</h4>
<h4>Cell Block</h4>
<p>Arn</p>
<p>Home to a proportion of the city&rsquo;s guard and the jail. The entrance  area has the chests you need to retrieve your items, either after you  serve your time or if you reach in from the sewer grate behind the  chests. The main cell block has cells on either side (Adept, unless a  quest-related cell) and a door at the opposite end leading to  Dragonsreach.</p>
<p>The cell to the west is of particular interest, as it comes decked  out with food and a variety of luxuries not normally associated with  jails. This is where the more prominent miscreants are kept, usually  after a drunken binge. A man named Arn is imprisoned in this location,  but only after you undertake Thieves Guild City Influence Quest;  Imitation Amnesty.</p>
<p><em>Evidence Chest<br />Prisoner Belongings Chest</em></p>
<h4>Dungeon Catacombs</h4>
<p>Below the cells are the Catacombs, ideally explored only after you  escape from your cell, and wish to weave your way to the small hub  chamber, where you can climb a ladder and stand on some barrels to reach  the chests which contain your belongings. Then open the barred door  [Expert] or drop down the hole to reach a ladder leading up and into [7]  Guard Barracks (East), down in the Plains District.</p>
