<h3>Lore: City Overview</h3>
<p>Sitting on the southern edge of the Drajkmyr marsh, dry ground can be hard to come by in Morthal. The capital of the Hjaalmarch Hold, Morthal, is often shrouded in a thick fog, and ominous twisted trees grow from the surrounding marsh.</p>
<p>Morthal is foreboding to travelers approaching it, and the torches of the town glowing in the fog often give the impression of wisps at a distance. Many travelers choose to steer clear of the place altogether.</p>
<p><br />Morthal is a town shrouded in mystery. Its people are reclusive and wary of newcomers, and only a single lumber camp supports its weak economy. The Jarl is among the most relaxed in Skyrim when it comes to taxation, but Hjaalmarch is also the poorest of the nine Holds.</p>
<p>The Hold is still part of the Empire, but the Jarl is unapologetically vague in her enthusiasm for the Imperial Legate stationed in her dwelling.</p>
<p>A number of the people in the town are concerned about the prospect of war. War brings outsiders, and outsiders are not a welcome sight in Morthal. Most would rather the conflict were kept outside their home, leaving them free to pursue their own interests.</p>
<h3>Important Areas of Interest</h3>
<h4>1) Main Thoroughfare</h4>
<p>Lacking much in the way of paving, this main dirt track leads from one end of town to the other, with Highmoon Hall to the south and the lumber mill at the north end, after which the marshland encroaches and takes over.</p>
<h4>2) Dockside</h4>
<p>This deck passes the structures where the town&rsquo;s guards and two of the more interesting inhabitants live and leads to a jetty. This is where the civilization of Morthal stops and the wilds of the Drajkmyr marsh begin.</p>
<p>The bog isn&rsquo;t particularly deep, and many townsfolk spend time watching the water from the covered jetty, hoping the strange sounds during the night will go away.</p>
<h4>3) Highmoon Hall</h4>
<div class="gameplay_image">

<div class="gameplay_image"><img src="jpg/sr_atlas/sr_atlas_2a-002.jpg" tppabs="http://www.primagames.com/games/media/files/skyrim/jpg/sr_atlas/sr_atlas_2a-002.jpg" border="0"  /></div>
The following leaders of Morthal are (begrudgingly) loyal to the Imperials at the start of the Civil War.</div>
<p><strong>Jarl Idgrod Ravencrone</strong><br /><strong>Aslfur (Steward)</strong><br /><strong>Gorm (Housecarl)</strong><br /><strong>Idgrod the Younger</strong><br /><strong>Joric</strong><br /><strong>Legate Taurinus Duilis</strong></p>
<h4><strong>Jarl Idgrod Ravencrone</strong></h4>
<p>Idgrod Ravencrone is unlike the other Jarls of Skyrim: She is a hunched old woman, who speaks in riddles and parables and rarely ever directly.</p>
<p>However, her wisdom is sometimes misunderstood as the ramblings of an old woman, and some are beginning to lose faith in her. Idgrod spent her younger years wandering Tamriel in search of wisdom. Some say that she returned from her trip &ldquo;touched.&rdquo; Gorm is actively plotting to remove her.</p>
<h4>Aslfur (Steward)</h4>
<p>Aslfur met Idgrod during the time she spent wandering Tamriel. A young warrior then, Aslfur protected Idgrod during her pilgrimage, and the two were married before returning to her home in Morthal.</p>
<p>Over the years, Aslfur has served as Idgrod&rsquo;s advisor, and now, in her old age (and some say her insanity), he is more protective than ever.</p>
<h4>Gorm (Housecarl)</h4>
<p>Gorm was once loyal to Idgrod but has since come to think of her as insane and unfit for the throne in these trying times. Gorm has formulated a plan to remove her from power with little bloodshed. Aslfur and Idgrod are both aware of his plan, but Idgrod has refused to allow Aslfur to act on the knowledge, insisting that there is a larger role for Gorm to play.</p>
<h4>Idgrod the Younger</h4>
<p>Idgrod the Younger has heard the rumors that her mother is touched. In truth, Idgrod has been taught by her mother to seek insight and wisdom.</p>
<p>Although neither recognize it, both are manipulating Magicka subconsciously in order to achieve their visions. The Younger Idgrod is much more adept at separating the visions from reality and is poised to make an excellent Jarl.</p>
<h4>Joric</h4>
<p>Joric is the youngest child of Idgrod Ravencrone and Aslfur. He&rsquo;s a young boy who seems to have lost his mind at a very early age. He doesn&rsquo;t say much, but when he does speak, he is oddly insightful, even if his words make little sense.</p>
<h4>Legate Taurinus Duilis</h4>
<p>The following residents of Hjaalmarch arrive to take control of Morthal, once this Hold has fallen during the Civil War.</p>
<p><strong>Jarl Sorli the Builder</strong><br /><strong>Pactur (Steward)</strong><br /><strong>Teeba-Ei (Housecarl)</strong><br /><strong>Jarl Sorli the Builder</strong></p>
<p>Sorli the Builder is the great-granddaughter of the founder of Stonehills. She lives in the first building constructed in the town by her ancestors. Leadership has been passed down through her family, but whatever that used to mean, it has little bearing on the present day.</p>
<p>Reduced to a single building and a marginally profitable mine owned by Bryling of Solitude, Sorli attempts to cling to whatever authority she currently has, while dreaming of something greater for herself.</p>
<h4>Pactur (Steward)</h4>
<p>Pactur&rsquo;s life revolves around Sorli. He assists with running the mine, which means doing all the work Sorli doesn&rsquo;t care to, and he feeds her ambitions in whatever way he can.</p>
<h4>Teeba-Ei (Housecarl)</h4>
<p>The sole survivor of a wrecked trader vessel, Teeba-Ei wandered into Stonehills nearly frozen to death.</p>
<p>He was taken in and cared for, and was grateful that few questions were asked about how he came to be there. He now gladly serves Sorli, working the mine, and is willing to follow her everywhere, even if that means going to Morthal as her Housecarl.</p>
<p><br />Highmoon Hall is the central meeting place for all citizens of Hjaalmarch. Although, few seek audience with the reclusive and mysterious Jarl. She spends most of her days pottering around this sturdy Nordic structure.</p>
<p>Aslfur handles many of the citizens&rsquo; grievances in the main hall, and some have come to question whether he is trying to remove that burden from his wife or trying to hide her deteriorating condition.</p>
<p>The war room manned by Legate Taurinus Duilis across from the Jarl&rsquo;s chamber is an inconvenience Idgrod is having to live with. Discover a Skill Book mixed in with other, less valuable books on the top shelf in the upstairs bedroom.</p>

<h4>4) Guardhouse</h4>
<p>Benor</p>
<p>The guardhouse is not a picture of military order. The Jarl of Hjaalmarch had little need for an organized militia.</p>
<p>The Legion has attempted to improve the old guardhouse and the jail (which is more of a cellar with a single cell [Adept]), but it is still a mess. Find a Skill Book hidden behind a basket and barrel near the bed.</p>

<p><strong>Jonna</strong><br /><strong>Lurbuk gro-Dushnikh</strong></p>
<p>Jonna is the sister of Falion, both from Hammerfell. She and her brother have traveled together their whole lives, but when something &ldquo;drew&rdquo; Falion to Morthal, they both settled. The town was without an inn at the time, so Jonna modified one of the homes.</p>
<p>She doesn&rsquo;t get a lot of business, but she does appreciate visitors who stop by and can stand to hear Lurbuk&rsquo;s painful ballads. Search a woven basket that sits atop a dresser in one of the rooms to discover a hidden Skill Book.</p>

<h4>6) Hroggar&rsquo;s House (Burned Down)</h4>
<p>Close to the chiming Nirnroot is a house without its roof. It has been lying derelict since it caught fire recently. The house belonged to Hroggar, and his wife and child died in the fire, which some are calling suspicious. Perhaps the barkeep has some scuttlebutt you could follow up on?</p>
<h4>7) Morthal Cemetery</h4>
<p>Too small for a Hall of the Dead, the few folks of Morthal make do with a more traditional Nordic graveyard to the west of town. Odd noises have been heard during the night there.</p>
<h4>8) Thaumaturgist&rsquo;s Hut</h4>

<h4>9) Thonnir&rsquo;s House</h4>
<p><strong>Thonnir</strong><br /><strong>Virkmund</strong></p>
<p>The place hasn&rsquo;t been cleaned for weeks and is sparsely decorated by a man who may have simply given up. The lute, drums, and flute show Thonnir once sang, but no merry music has echoed around these walls for months. Claim a Skill Book that&rsquo;s stashed beneath a basket on the corner shelf.</p>

<h4>10) Alva&rsquo;s House [Locked: Adept]</h4>
<p>Alva<br />Hroggar</p>
<p>Alva spends her nights gathering herbs and tending her small herb garden. She has filled the house with all manner of dried ingredients and homemade remedies. She used to spend a lot of time with Lami but now refuses to leave her abode.</p>
<p>If you break into this dwelling, Alva wakes from her slumber and attacks. There&rsquo;s a key on her corpse. The cellar backs up the rumors of Alva&rsquo;s vampiric tendencies. If you kill Alva, Hroggar will stalk and attack you once you leave town.</p>

<p>Falion is a Redguard. While his sister Jonna is accepted by the people of Morthal, Falion is looked at with fear and distrust. Falion has delved deep into the mysteries of Magicka and has become a master of the arts.</p>
<p>He has settled in Morthal because he felt drawn to the location and wishes to remain relatively close to the College in Winterhold.</p>
<p>He spends his time in his workshop and is the only person in the realm who knows how to cure vampirism. The house is cluttered and filled with trinkets of both superstition and genuine implements of Magicka. Peer around his residence for the following:</p>
<p><em>Crafting: Arcane Enchanter</em><br /><em>Trader (Spells Vendor: Falion) [2/13]</em><br /><em>Scrolls, Books, Misc</em><br /><em>Trainer (Conjuration: Master): Falion [1/3]</em><br /><em>Skill Book [Restoration]: 2920, Rain&rsquo;s Hand, v4 [A1/10]</em><br /><em>Skill Book [Enchanting]: Catalogue of Armor Enchantments [B1/10]</em><br /><em>Chest</em><br /><em>Potions aplenty</em></p>
<h4>12) Jorgen and Lami&rsquo;s House [Locked: Novice]</h4>
<p><strong>Jorgen</strong><br /><strong>Lami</strong></p>
<p>Jorgen and Lami live in this small house, although both are rarely ever home, spending most of their time at their respective work.</p>
<p>The house is neat, in order, features a variety of stored food, and is barely lived in. Find a Skill Book hidden atop a tall cupboard and another tucked away in a bucket that sits atop a barrel.</p>
<p><em>Hilt of Mehrunes&rsquo; Razor</em><br /><em>Skill Book [One-Handed]: 2920, Morning Star, v1 </em><br /><em>Chest [Locked: Adept]</em><br /><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<h4>13) Lumber Mill (Marshdeep Camp)</h4>
<p>This was once known as Marshdeep Camp before being settled and is now the only economy of Morthal. The sparse (but healthy and large) trees are processed here. Jorgen runs this with Hroggar and doesn&rsquo;t care about what happened in the fire.</p>
<p><em>Crafting: Grindstone, Tanning Rack</em></p>
