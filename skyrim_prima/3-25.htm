						<h4>23) Understone Keep</h4>
<div class="gameplay_image">
<div class="enlarge"><a target="_blank">Please click to enlarge</a></div>
<img src="sr_atlas_5a-011.jpg" tppabs="http://www.primagames.com/games/elder-scrolls-v-skyrim/media/files/skyrim/sr_atlas_5a-011.jpg" border="0" width="437" /></div>
<p>The following leaders of Markarth are loyal to the Imperials at the start of the Civil War.</p>
<p><strong>Jarl Igmund<br />Raerek (Steward)<br />Faleen (Housecarl)<br />Legate Emmanuel Admand<br />Thongvor Silver-Blood<br />Reburrus Quintilius (Steward)<br />Yngvar (Housecarl)<br />Calcelmo (Court wizard)<br />Aicantar<br />Anton Virane<br />Rondach and Voada<br />Blacksmith: Moth gro-Bagol<br />Ondolemar<br /></strong></p>
<p><strong>Jarl Igmund</strong></p>
<p>Jarl Igmund, son of Hrolfdir and nephew of Raerek, recently took the   throne when Hrolfdir was killed in battle with the Forsworn. Igmund is   an Imperial supporter (some might say a puppet) and holds court all day   and eats and sleeps in the Keep. He sits upon the Mournful Throne, a   relic and seat of power famous for centuries across the Reach.</p>
<p><strong>Raerek (Steward)</strong></p>
<p>Igmund&rsquo;s Steward and successor manages the household, serves as the treasurer, and commands the palace guard.</p>
<p><em>Unique Item: Raerek&rsquo;s Inscribed Amulet of Talos [48/112]</em></p>
<p><strong>Faleen (Housecarl)</strong></p>
<p>She is completely loyal and very competent. She was Igmund&rsquo;s father&rsquo;s   Housecarl and managed to escape from the ambush with the gravely   wounded Igmund, although she blames herself for not being able to do   more. As a result, she is almost paranoid about Igmund&rsquo;s security and   will rarely allow him out of her sight.</p>
<p><strong>Legate Emmanuel Admand</strong></p>
<p>The following residents of Markarth arrive to take control once this Hold has fallen during the Civil War.</p>
<p><strong>Thongvor Silver-Blood</strong></p>
<p>Thongvor is the head of the Silver-Blood family, who controls the   majority of Markarth&rsquo;s wealth. More involved in politics and Ulfric&rsquo;s   rebellion, Thongvor leaves the business operations of the family to his   brother Thonar.</p>
<p><strong>Reburrus Quintilius (Steward)</strong></p>
<p>Reburrus Quintilius is the steward to Thongvor. His family has served   as the chief financial and political advisors to the Silver-Blood   family for generations, and Reburrus has distilled the wisdom of the   generations to a fine art.</p>
<p><strong>Yngvar (Housecarl)</strong></p>
<p>The huge housecarl to the Silver-Blood family, Yngvar has a   reputation for cheerful brutality. He is completely loyal to the   Silver-Blood clan and loves his job. He particularly loves it when he   can beat someone to a pulp. But he is also surprisingly cultured; he   attended the Bard&rsquo;s College as a youth, until he found better employment   using his other talents.</p>
<p>The following citizens are staff of Understone Keep:</p>
<p><strong>Calcelmo (Court wizard)</strong></p>
<p>Calcelmo is here in order to study the Dwemer ruins in and around the   city. He views his duties as the castle mage as a distraction from his   main scholarly interest. He is completely uninterested (and mainly   unaware) of politics. He has been quite put out by the Forsworn   situation, which has prevented him from doing his usual wide-ranging   travels. He is secretly in love with Faleen, although he has never told   anyone else or done anything about it.</p>
<p><em>Trader (Spell Vendor): Calcelmo [9/12]</em></p>
<p><strong>Aicantar</strong></p>
<p>Aicantar is Calcelmo&rsquo;s assistant and nephew. He is less than enthused   by his uncle&rsquo;s plans to study more dangerous Dwemer Ruins and prefers   they spend time studying spells and enchanting. Aicantar is aware of   Calcelmo&rsquo;s secret love for Faleen but is unlikely to do anything about   it directly. Faleen scares Aicantar, and the thought of her being around   the laboratory more makes him nervous.</p>
<p><strong>Anton Virane</strong></p>
<p>Anton is a genuine Breton from High Rock in a city of Reachmen, a   fact that constantly annoys him (because everyone assumes he&rsquo;s a   Reachman). He is particularly bigoted toward Reachmen. He is an   excellent cook, though, which is why the Jarl continues to tolerate him.</p>
<p><strong>Rondach and Voada<br />Moth gro-Bagol</strong></p>
<p><em>Trader (Blacksmith): Moth gro-Bagol [12/33]</em></p>
<p><strong>Ondolemar</strong></p>
<p>Ondolemar is the head of the Thalmor Justiciars in Markarth, and a   prime example of why most folk hate the Thalmor. Ondolemar is completely   confident in the Dominion&rsquo;s ultimate victory over the Empire. He&rsquo;s a   Thalmor true believer, and is not here if the Stormcloaks take this city   during the Civil War.</p>
<p>Understone Keep is a gigantic dwarven structure, now used as the   city&rsquo;s castle. Built by the Dwemer into the western wall of the canyon,   the Castle Wizard, Calcelmo, has recently uncovered additional chambers   (and worrying underground monstrosities) and a wealth of artifacts  that  he keeps in his museum. The sheer size of this place and ability  to be  well guarded negates some of the instability the location has  recently  suffered from.</p>
<h4>Understone Keep (Interior): Entrance to the Mournful Throne</h4>
<p>The first time you enter via the main doors, Thongvor Silver-Blood is   having a heated discussion with Brother Verulus about the worship of   the outlawed deity, Talos. At this huge intersection of stone and fire,   head left to Nchuand-Zel&rsquo;s entrance, right to the Dwemer Museum or on  to  meet the Jarl, who is guarded by both Markarth Guards and Thalmor   Soldiers. Jarl Igmund sits on the Mournful Throne, usually with his   Steward and Housecarl by him. Outside, on the upper top of the stairs   where Ondolemar and his guards like to stride about, are two stone   tables. The one to the right (northwest) houses a Skill Book.</p>
<p><em>Skill Book [Alteration]: Daughter of the Niben [B1/10]</em></p>
<h4><strong>Kitchens</strong></h4>
<p>To the left (south) of the throne room are the kitchens. The two   hounds around here are large but friendly. Inside, you usually find   Voada and Rondach and the short-tempered Anton Virane. As expected,   there&rsquo;s a massive amount of food in here.</p>
<h4><strong>Jarl&rsquo;s Chamber (Locked: Adept)</strong></h4>
<p>Igmund rests here, behind the large golden door to the left   (southeast) of the throne room. If you&rsquo;re going to sift through his   personal belongings, remember to try the ones on the stone shelf facing   the subterranean river that dominates the rear of the chamber.</p>
<p><em>Skill Book [Conjuration]: The Warrior&rsquo;s Charge [E1/10]<br />Loose gear</em></p>
<h4><strong>Understone Forge</strong></h4>
<p>This is located to the right (north) of the throne room. Moth   gro-Bagol works here, while his sister Ghorza tends to the Blacksmith   Forge outside.</p>
<p><em>Crafting: Blacksmith Forge, Grindstone, Tanning Rack, Workbench<br />Marriage Prospect: Ghorza gra-Bagol [18/62]<br />Marriage Prospect: Moth gro-Bagol [19/62]<br />Trader (Blacksmith): Moth gro-Bagol [12/34]<br />Weapons, Apparel, Misc.<br />Trainer (Smithing: Journeyman): Ghorza [1/3]<br />Loose gea</em>r</p>
<h4><strong>Bedrooms</strong></h4>
<p>You are trespassing if you head into this area! To the right   (northwest) are bedrooms for the more important members of the Jarl&rsquo;s   counsel. Faleen&rsquo;s room (sometimes locked: Adept) is to the right, with   the large dinner table, a Key to Markarth Keep that opens the two other   nearby doors, and the Jarl&rsquo;s Quarters. Raerek (sometimes locked: Adept)   houses the steward, a Key, and his secret Talos-loving reading   materials. Up the stairs is a third room (sometimes locked: Apprentice)   leading to the Imperial War Room, where Legate Emmanuel Admand is   overseeing the Civil War in this territory.</p>

<h4><strong>Markarth Wizards Quarters</strong></h4>
<p>Unless you&rsquo;ve been given approval by Calcelmo, you are trespassing in   the following areas. You are unable to head farther into the  laboratory  or tower unless Thieves Guild Quest: Hard Answers is active,  so plan to  loot the three connected areas during this quest.</p>
<h4><strong>Dwemer Museum (Locked: Adept)</strong></h4>
<p>The Dwemer Museum showcases Calcelmo&rsquo;s collection of artifacts   recovered from ruins across Skyrim. Only three guards patrol this area,   keeping watch for intruders. This space is normally off-limits&mdash;the   guards will aggressively arrest you if you trespass here&mdash;but you can get   Calcelmo&rsquo;s permission to visit the museum in any number of ways; see   Thieves Guild Quest: Hard Answers for details.</p>
<p>The Museum has the finest collection of Dwarven artifacts (weapons,   armor, items, and books) in the entirety of Skyrim and the highest   concentration of locked containers in any area of the game. There&rsquo;s even   a small selection of Falmer items. To the south is a gate (Apprentice)   leading to a small workshop with an Unusual Gem and locked chest   (Expert). To the northwest is a locked gate (Adept) to a two-level   storage room. Up the steps to the west is the laboratory door.</p>
<p><em>Unusual Gem: [9/24]<br />Display Case (3)<br />Display Case (Novice) (5)<br />Display Case (Apprentice) (2)<br />Display Case (Adept) (7)<br />Display Case (Expert) (14)<br />Chest (Adept)<br />Chest (Expert)<br />Loose gear</em></p>
<h4><strong>Calcelmo&rsquo;s Laboratory</strong></h4>
<p>This area is the main living and research quarters for Calcelmo and   Aicantar, although they typically spend most of their time in the Keep,   closer to the Nchuand-Zel Entrance. Most of this area is locked unless   you&rsquo;re on Thieves Guild Quest: Hard Answers; see that quest for an   exhaustive walkthrough of quest events in this space.</p>
<p>The laboratory is divided into a number of chambers. The Entry Room   has oil on the floor, a dart trap, and a gate you can&rsquo;t normally open to   the southeast.</p>
<p><em>Danger! Dart Trap, Oil Pool Trap<br />Unique Weapon: Spider Control Rod [30/80] (quest only)</em></p>
<p>The Throne Chamber consists of a main room with a raised throne and   guard. Dwarven junk (or is it research?) is scattered around, along with   several traps you can activate. To the northwest is Calcelmo&rsquo;s  bedroom,  which has some display cases (Apprentice) and scrolls to  steal. To the  south is Aicantar&rsquo;s bedroom and food preparation area.</p>
<p><em>Danger! Dwarven Ballista Trap, Dwarven Thresher Trap, Swinging Wall Trap<br />Display Case (Apprentice)<br />Loose gear</em></p>
<p>You cannot progress beyond the Throne door without a key, which you can only find during Thieves Guild Quest: Hard Answers.</p>
<p>Beyond the Throne Room is the Steam Hall. There&rsquo;s little to search   for, except a few corpses of fallen foes. The valve at the far end   activates the thresher traps in the floor, ideally against enemies   following you.</p>
<p><em>Danger! Dwarven Thresher Trap, Poison Gas Trap</em></p>
<p>Next is the Statue Room, whose exit is flanked by two Dwarven   Spheres. There are two side chambers here; take advantage of the guard&rsquo;s   patrol to slip through the door when he steps away from it.</p>
<p>And finally, you emerge into a large workroom. The valve in the   control booth sets off a frightening number of traps in the room that   will send even the most stout-hearted guard running for cover. This area   has the following items and two exits.</p>
<p><em>Danger! Dwarven Ballista Trap, Dwarven Thresher Trap, Flamethrower Trap<br />Crafting: Arcane Enchanter<br />Larceny Target: Dwemer Puzzle Cube [4/7]<br />Skill Book [Enchanting]: Twin Secrets<br />Chest<br />Loose gear</em></p>
<h4>Markarth Wizards&rsquo; Balcony</h4>
<p>The great balcony atop the keep connects Calcelmo&rsquo;s laboratory to his   tower, a separate structure off the main body of the Keep. There&rsquo;s a   great view of the city from here. One section of the balcony wall has   broken away, exposing a path around the cliffside that ends in a   waterfall. If you were in a hurry, you might just be able to jump from   here.</p>
<h4>Calcelmo&rsquo;s Tower (Locked: Requires Key)</h4>
<p>The tower (accessible only during Thieves Guild Quest: Hard Answers)   has a lower-level entry hall, an upper-level office, and a massive  stone  relic containing a text in Dwemer and Falmer on the same granite  slab!  This stone is the key to Calcelmo&rsquo;s current research, a secret he   jealously protects.</p>

<p>The epic cavern is usually where Calcelmo and Aicantar can be found,   dedicating their lives to researching this mighty dwarven stronghold of   historic significance. When you emerge from the entrance cavern close  to  the throne room, you are greeted by a rushing river, various curved   passageways, and circular towers (one with seats to sit on and gaze  down  at the rushing water), as well as an entrance to the Hall of the  Dead.  Of more significance is the entrance to Nchuand-Zel itself. Enter  here,  either before speaking to Calcelmo (Locked: Adept) or after  acquiring  the key and agreeing to slay a large spider for him  (Miscellaneous  Objective: Neutralizing Nimhe*).</p>
