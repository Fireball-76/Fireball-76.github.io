<h2>4.1 Skill Constellations Introduction</h2>
<img src="01a.063.jpg" border="0">
<p>This vast section of knowledge explores the entirety of the Skill Constellations. These are color-coded for Combat Skills: The Path of Might (red), Stealth Skills: The Path of Shadow (green), and Magic Skills: The Path of Sorcery (blue).</p>
<p>There are three general categories of perks that deserve special mention:</p>
<p>Skill Improvement Perks: Many constellations offer a perk that simply makes you better at that Skill&rsquo;s primary effect (examples include Agile Defender for Light Armor, Juggernaut for Heavy Armor, Stealth for Sneak, as well as others).</p>
<p>Choosing these perks is akin to receiving a huge number of Skill increases for that Skill all at once. These perks may not be as &ldquo;flashy&rdquo; or instantly gratifying as some of the other perks, but they are always a strong, effective choice.</p>
<p>Magic Rank Perks: The five schools of magic each have a series of &ldquo;rank&rdquo; perks (Novice, Apprentice, Adept, Expert, and Master) that dramatically decrease the cost of spells from that School.</p>
<p>These perks are absolutely critical to your ability to use magic effectively, and should be a top priority for any serious Mage.</p>
<p>Tiered Perks: Some perks can be selected multiple times for increased effect. These bonuses do not stack. For example, Heavy Armor&rsquo;s Juggernaut 1 Perk increases your armor rating by 20%, while Juggernaut 2 increases your armor rating by 40%.</p>
<p>After taking Juggernaut 2, you will have a bonus of 40%, not 60%.</p>
